The authors of the species wrote "The specific name covidum was chosen as homage to the numerous casualties worldwide of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, a large part of this study was written during the lockdowns."[1]

The species was initially mentioned as Diversibipalium "black" in 2018, when the authors of a study on hammerhead flatworms had only a few available specimens and could not complete an anatomical study.[2] At this time, the species was assigned to the genus Diversibipalium Kawakatsu et al., 2002, a collective group created to accommodate species whose anatomy of the copulatory apparatus is still unknown,[3] and was not given a Latin species name. It was formally described as a new species in 2022 when more specimens were available (mainly from Italy) and was assigned to genus Humbertium on the basis of the anatomy of its copulatory apparatus.[4][1] The study also included a comparison with several land flatworms of the subfamily Bipaliinae, including the description and comparison of the complete mitochondrial genomes in several species.[1][5]

Distribution and origin
Humbertium covidum was described from specimens collected in two localities in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques, a department in the southwest corner of France, and specimens collected in one locality in Veneto, in northeastern Italy.[1] It was also probably recorded (under its synonym Diversibipalium "black") near Rome, Italy.[6]

The origin of the species is unknown, but since most of hammerhead flatworms originate from Asia, the authors of the study wrote that it was "probably a species originating from Asia and an alien species in Europe".[1] A few records of specimens resembling H. covidum were found in the literature, in China, eastern Russia, and Japan, but these records could not be assigned to the species wither certainty in the absence of specimens and molecular information.[1]

Genetics and phylogenetic relationships
The mitochondrial genome of Italian specimens of Humbertium covidum, is circular, 15,540 base pairs long and contains 12 protein coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes and 21 transfer RNA genes. The ND3 gene was found with a premature stop codon. In French specimens, the characteristics were similar but the length was 15,989 base pairs.[1] A comparative study of the Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene, widely used for DNA barcoding, found that the sequences from France and Italy differed by 2.58%, a distance compatible with intraspecific differences.[1]

Main subject classifications
Wikipedia's main navigation subsystems (overviews, outlines, lists, portals, glossaries, categories, and indices) are each divided into the following subject classifications:

Culture – encompasses the social behavior and norms found in human societies, as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities and habits of the individuals in these groups.
Geography – field of science devoted to the study of the lands, features, inhabitants, and phenomena of the Earth and planets.
Health – state of physical, mental and social well-being.
History – the past as it is described in written documents, and the study thereof.
Human activities – the various activities done by people. For instance, it includes leisure, entertainment, industry, recreation, war, and exercise.
Mathematics – the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. It evolved through the use of abstraction and logical reasoning, from counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects.
Natural science – branch of science concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena, based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation.
People – plurality of persons considered as a whole, as is the case with an ethnic group or nation.
Philosophy – study of general and fundamental questions about existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language.
Reference works – compendiums of information, usually of a specific type, compiled in a book for ease of reference. That is, the information is intended to be quickly found when needed.
Religions – social-cultural systems of designated behaviors and practices, morals, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics, or organizations, that relates humanity to supernatural, transcendental, or spiritual elements.
Society – group of individuals involved in persistent social interaction, or a large social group sharing the same geographical or social territory, typically subject to the same political authority and dominant cultural expectations. Societies are characterized by patterns of relationships (social relations) between individuals who share a distinctive culture and institutions; a given society may be described as the sum/total of such relationships among its constituent of members.
Technology – the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation.
Curated article collections
Overview articles
Overview articles summarize in prose a broad topic like biology, and also have illustrations and links to subtopics like cell biology, biographies like Carl Linnaeus, and other related articles like Human Genome Project.

Wikipedia:Contents/Overviews lists overview articles from covered fields in a single page.
Outline pages
Outline pages have trees of topics in an outline format, which in turn are linked to further outlines and articles providing more detail. Outlines show how important subtopics relate to each other based on how they are arranged in the tree, and they are useful as a more condensed, non-prose alternative to overview articles.

Wikipedia:Contents/Outlines is a comprehensive list of "Outline of __" pages, organized by subject. It is itself an outline, that links (almost) exclusively to other outlines.
Outline of academic disciplines covers subjects studied in college or university and provides links to prose overview articles and their corresponding outlines.
Outline of knowledge is the top-level outline, its subject being the broadest one of all. It is the ancestor of all other outlines, and they branch out from it, in successive levels.
List of articles every Wikipedia should have
Main article: meta:List of articles every Wikipedia should have
These articles are considered the foundation that every Wikipedia should build upon.

meta:List of articles every Wikipedia should have - 1,000 most important articles
meta:List of articles every Wikipedia should have/Expanded - 10,000 most important articles
Vital articles
Main page: Wikipedia:Vital articles
Vital articles are lists of subjects for which the English Wikipedia should have corresponding high-quality articles. They serve as centralized watchlists to track the quality status of Wikipedia's most important articles and to give editors guidance on which articles to prioritize for improvement.

Vital articles level 1 – 10 most important articles
Vital articles level 2 – 100 most important articles
Vital articles level 3 – 1,000 most important articles
Vital articles level 4 – 10,000 most important articles
Vital articles level 5 – 50,000 most important articles

Reference collections
Wikipedia has several types of pages which provide content in a non-prose form, for reference purposes.

List pages
List pages enumerate items of a particular type, such as the List of sovereign states or List of South Africans. Wikipedia has "lists of lists" when there are too many items to fit on a single page, when the items can be sorted in different ways, or as a way of navigating lists on a topic (for example Lists of countries and territories or Lists of people). There are several ways to find lists:

Wikipedia:Contents/Lists – A limited single-page collection of lists and lists of lists
List of lists of lists – A broad single-page collection of lists of lists
Category:Lists – Browse lists comprehensively via the multi-page Wikipedia category system
Timelines
Timelines list events chronologically, sometimes including links to articles with more detail. There are several ways to find timelines:

List of timelines has a long single-page collection
Category:Wikipedia timelines has a comprehensive multi-page collection via the Wikipedia category system
Of particular interest may be:

List of centuries
List of decades
List of historical anniversaries – e.g. events on January 1 of any year
Category:Graphical timelines – graphical timelines in the category and subcategories, arranged alphabetically
Glossaries
Glossaries are lists of terms with definitions. Wikipedia includes hundreds of alphabetical glossaries; they can be found two ways:

Wikipedia:Contents/Glossaries – A single-page list of glossaries
Category:Wikipedia glossaries – Browse glossaries comprehensively via the Wikipedia category system
Bibliographies
Bibliographies list sources on a given topic, for verification or further reading outside Wikipedia:

Wikipedia:List of bibliographies is a list of bibliographies
Category:Wikipedia bibliographies has a complete multi-page listing of bibliographies on Wikipedia

Discographies catalog the sound recordings of individual artists or groups.

Category:Discographies has a complete multi-page listing
Special format collections
Portals
Portals contain featured articles and images, news, categories, excerpts of key articles, links to related portals, and to-do lists for editors. There are two ways to find portals:

Wikipedia:Contents/Portals – A single-page list of portals
Category:Portals – Browse portals comprehensively via the Wikipedia category system.
Spoken articles
Growing collections of Wikipedia articles are starting to become available as spoken word recordings as well.

Category:Spoken articles – an organized list of all spoken articles

Collections of articles
Category system
Wikipedia's collection of category pages is a classified index system. It is automatically generated from category tags at the bottoms of articles and most other pages. Nearly all of the articles available so far on the website can be found through these subject indexes.

If you are simply looking to browse articles by topic, there are two top-level pages to choose from:

Category:Main topic classifications – probably what you are looking for: Arts, History, Technology, etc.
Wikipedia:Contents/Categories – a hand-crafted list of first- and second-level topic categories
For biographies, see Category:People.

Category:Contents is technically at the top of the category hierarchy, but contains many categories useful to editors but not readers. Special:Categories lists every category alphabetically.

Alphabetical lists of articles
